PDRs are Photon Dominated Regions in the interstellar medium. A PDR model computes the chemical and thermodynamical balance in these regions and their emission signature (see e.g.  https://www.astro.uni-koeln.de/node/346).

WL-PDR is a port of the simple toy PDR model PyPDR written by Simon Bruderer (2019). This is not meant to be a model for real world applications but to test certain numerical or physical aspects of PDR modelling in a very simple model setup.

The model is published in Röllig & Ossenkopf-Okada 2022 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220504233R/abstract ).
